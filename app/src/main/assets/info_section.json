  "Korea at a Glance":
  {
    "About Korea": "The Korean peninsula is located on the far easternedge of Asia. About 70% of its landmass is covered with mountains, making Korea one of the most mountainous regions in the world. It is also famous for its picturesque landscapes of hills and valleys. Korea has a rich culture, particularly in history and art. \n\nThe Korean peninsula is currently divided slightly north of the 38th parallel line. The Republic of Korea (South Korea) is situated south of this line, whereas the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is situated in the north. South Korea is a developed country with a free market economy, and is a member of both the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and G20. \n\nKorea is gaining prominence in culture and sports. It hosted the 1988 Seoul Olympics and the 2002 Korea-Japan FIFA World Cup. Korea also won the bid to host the 2018 Winter Olympics. Recently, Korean pop culture is becoming increasingly popular around the world. In particular, Korean TV shows, movies, and music are attracting global audiences.\n\n",
    "General Information": "•Country Name - Republic of Korea (South Korea)\n\n•Capital - Seoul\n\n•Territory - 100,210 squared km\n\n•National Flag - Taegeukgi\n\n•National Flower - Mugunghwa (Rose of Sharon)\n\n•Language - Korean (Writing System: Hangeul)\n\n•Currency - won\n\n•Population - About 50 million\n\n•Political System - Democratic Republic, Presidential System (single 5-year term)\n\n•Time Zone - GMT +9 hours\n\n•Climate - Continental climate with four distinct seasons\n",
    "Weather and Climate": "Korea has four distinct seasons, with a hot and humid summer season and a cold winter from November to March. In April, flower blossoms mark the beginning of spring. Temperatures can rise to 36˚C in the summer with episodes of heavy rainfall.\n\nIn the fall you will be able to enjoy much cooler weather and beautiful autumn foliage. During the winter, temperatures can drop to as low as -15˚C and it often snows. You may want to prepare for extreme weather in summer and winter.",
    "Food": "Generally, Korean food is not served in separate courses like it is in most Western countries. Rather, all dishes are placed on the table at once. A Korean meal almost always consists of rice, soup, various side dishes (mostly seasoned vegetables) and meat. A Korean meal is never complete without kimchi, or fermented Korean cabbage. Rice and soup are served in individual bowls, but side dishes are served and shared in small dishes at the center of the table.",
    "Language": "Korean is the official language of Korea. The “standard” Korean dialect is mainly spoken by the residents of Seoul. There are several regional dialects, but Koreans are able to communicate across different dialects without much difficulty.\n\nHangul is Korea’s official alphabet and was invented in 1443 under the leadership of “King Sejong the Great” with the goal of promoting literacy among the common people. Hangul is composed of 24 simple letters: 10 vowels and 14 consonants.\n\nWords are created by combining the letters into syllable blocks. Hangul is simple, yet systematic and comprehensive, and is arguably one of the most scientific writing systems in the world.",
